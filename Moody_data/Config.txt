# To specify a foot spacing in mm, use
# M in the first column followed by
# a space and the spacing in mm.
# For example 66mm foot spacing would be:
# M 66.0
#
# To specify a foot spacing in inches, use
# I in the first column followed by
# a space and the spacing in inches.
# Moody used a 4-inch foot spacing.
#
# Note: if multiple foot spacings are given,
# on different lines, only the FIRST one is
# used, and the remainder are ignored!
